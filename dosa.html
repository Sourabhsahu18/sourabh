<p><b>Ingredients:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of rice (regular white rice or parboiled rice) </li>
        <li>1/4 cup of urad dal (split black gram)</li>
        <li>  1/2 teaspoon of fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li> Oil or ghee for cooking</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of chana dal (split chickpeas)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<b>Instructions:</b>
<ol>
<li>Rinse the rice, urad dal, chana dal, and fenugreek seeds separately under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them all together in water for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight.</li>
<li>After soaking, drain the water and add the rice and dal mixture to a blender. Add some water (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup) and blend until you get a smooth batter. The batter should have a slightly thick consistency, similar to pancake batter. Add salt to taste and mix well.</li>
<li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl and let it ferment in a warm place for about 8-12 hours or overnight. During fermentation, the batter will rise and become slightly fluffy.</li>
<li>Once the batter is fermented, give it a gentle stir. If it's too thick, you can add a little water to adjust the consistency.</li>
<li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, lightly grease the skillet with oil or ghee.</li>
<li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the skillet and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. You can make the dosa as thin or thick as you like, depending on your preference.</li>
<li>Drizzle some oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden brown and crisp.</li>
<li>Flip the dosa using a spatula and cook the other side for another minute or until it's cooked through and lightly browned.</li>
<li>Remove the dosa from the skillet and serve hot with your favorite chutney, sambar, or any other accompaniment of your choice.</li>
<li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet lightly before making each dosa</li>

Enjoy your homemade dosas!
