    </ul>
<h1>Instructions:</h1>

<ol>
    <li>Dry roast the semolina in a pan on medium heat until it turns aromatic and light golden brown. Keep stirring continuously to prevent burning. Once done, transfer it to a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>In the same pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
 </li>
    <li>Add cumin seeds, urad dal, and chana dal. Fry until the dals turn golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add chopped green chilies and ginger. Sauté for a minute until they release their aroma.</li>
    <li>Add chopped onions and cook until they turn translucent.</li>
    <li>If using, add chopped carrots and peas. Sauté for a couple of minutes until they soften slightly.</li>
    <li>Pour in 2 cups of water and add salt to taste. Bring the water to a boil.</li>
    <li>Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and slowly add the roasted semolina, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</li>
    <li>Cook the upma on low heat, stirring frequently, until it thickens and the semolina is cooked completely. It should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once done, turn off the heat and let the upma rest for a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves if desired.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with a wedge of lemon on the side for squeezing over the upma.</li>
</ol>
